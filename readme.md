# Overgrowth Phoenix bones blender plugin for Blender 2.92+

I think the title is pretty good at explaining what this is no ?

The wiki has a [nice tutorial](https://wiki.wolfire.com/index.php/Custom_Characters) to guide you through the process of making a new character to the game. Except now you don't need to use the old Blender 2.55 to export the bones to the .phxbn format.

## Installation

To do this, download the files and compress the folder into a .zip file. Then go into **Edit > Preferences...** and select the **Add-ons** tab on the left.

Now click on the **Install...** button on the top right and navigate to the .zip file you created and select it.

You should now see something like this :

Don't forget to enable the add-on by ticking a mark in the checkbox. Save your preferences if needed and you're free to go.

Make sure you triangulate you model before (Ctrl+T)! Now select the skeleton only and then export like any other files:

Wow, so majestic.
